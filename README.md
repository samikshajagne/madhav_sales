I've developed an interactive dashboard to track and analyze online sales data. Here are some of the key learnings and features:

ğŸ”¹ Created interactive dashboards for detailed analysis.
ğŸ”¹ Utilized complex parameters for in-depth data drilling with filters and slicers.
ğŸ”¹ Established connections, joined tables, and performed calculations for advanced data manipulation.
ğŸ”¹ Leveraged a variety of visualizations including bar charts, pie charts, donut charts, clustered bar charts, scatter plots, line charts, area charts, maps, and slicers.

This project has significantly enhanced my data visualization and analytical skills. Can't wait to apply these insights to future projects!
